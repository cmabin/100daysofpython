#Angela's Solution
#weight_as_int = int(weight)
#height_as_float = float(height)

#Variables
height = float(height)
weight = int(weight)

#Using exponent operator
#bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2

bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2

#Multiplication and PEMDAS
#bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)


print(bmi_as_int)
